# Redis feed
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/joahking/redis_feed.png)](http://travis-ci.org/joahking/redis_feed)

A minimal activity feed written in redis. It is the feed in use in http://para.pent.es

## TODO
* read events from inbox
* events partials
* move specs from para.pent.es in here
* DSL in models
* unsubscribe (I don't need it now)
* generators, rails integration
